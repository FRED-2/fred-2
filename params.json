It  offers consistent, easy, and simultaneous access to well established prediction methods for MHC binding and antigen processing. FRED can handle polymorphic proteins and offers analysis tools to select, assemble, and design linker sequences for string-of-beads epitope-based vaccines. It is implemented in Python in a modular way and can easily be extended by user defined methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nuse the following commands:\r\n\r\n    $ python setup.py sdist\r\n    #replace [x] with current version\r\n    $ pip install dist/Fred2-2.[x].tar.gz\r\n","google":"UA-68818359-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
